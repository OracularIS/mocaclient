- This action triggers the Log/Load into DB script, which performs the following:

  - Creates two temporary tables:
    - usr_temp_sql_trace_analysis
    - usr_temp_cmd_trace_analysis
  - Loads these tables with relevant entries from the specified trace file.

- **Load Recent:**
  - Click the Load Recent button to populate the trace selection dropdown.
  - This dropdown will display traces from the current day by default, allowing for quick access to the most recent entries.
