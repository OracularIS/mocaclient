## DevOps

The Smart MOCA Client offers a robust set of DevOps features designed to streamline file system management, source code maintenance, change management, and more. 

This document outlines these features and their functionalities.

## DB Trace

**Database Tracing** is a powerful diagnostic feature that allows users to monitor and analyze database operations in real time. It helps in tracking SQL queries, identifying performance issues, and capturing detailed logs of database activity for troubleshooting and in-depth analysis.

### Database Trace Console

- Navigate to **MOCALog** --> **Database Trace Console** to open **Trace Analysis** window.

  - Enter a **trace filename** (note: providing the full path to the log directory is not required).
  - After entering the filename, click **Insert into DB**.

- This action triggers the Log/Load into DB script, which performs the following:

  - Creates two temporary tables:
    - usr_temp_sql_trace_analysis
    - usr_temp_cmd_trace_analysis
  - Loads these tables with relevant entries from the specified trace file.

- **Load Recent:**
  - Click the Load Recent button to populate the trace selection dropdown.
  - This dropdown will display traces from the current day by default, allowing for quick access to the most recent entries.
