# Smart MOCA Trace

This section will guide you how to get Trace in MOCA. It helps us understand whatâ€™s happening in the system when a command runs. It shows step-by-step details, making it easier to find issues and fix them.

Following are the three steps for MOCA Trace.
1. By Clicking on **Start Trace** Button.
2. By Entering **Command**.
3. By **Log** Button.

## Using Start Trace Button

- Click on the **Start Trace** Button and execute Command for taking it's Trace.

- There are three main components for explaining Trace.


    - On left side we have console trace which outputs the sequence of calls and asynchronous events leading to the current console used for debugging and understanding what is happening in your code.

    - On the right top grid, there is hierarchy of executed commands with execution status which can be expanded.

    - On the right bottom grid, we have below tabs:
        - Format syntax: Used for Formating syntax of the command.
        - Arguments: Shows all the Arguments that are used in it.
        - Arguments (Not-Null): Shows Arguments that have some value stored in it which are not null.
        - All Messages: Shows All the messages.

    - Error
    - Search Functionality
