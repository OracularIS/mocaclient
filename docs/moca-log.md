# MOCA Log
The **MOCA Log** section in the Smart MOCA Client provides a set of tools for analyzing, parsing, and interacting with trace and log files generated by the MOCA.

- To access the log tools, click on **MOCA Log** from the main toolbar to open the **Log Menu**.

## Database Trace Console

**Database Tracing** is a powerful diagnostic feature that allows users to monitor and analyze database operations in real time. It helps in tracking SQL queries, identifying performance issues, and capturing detailed logs of database activity for troubleshooting and in-depth analysis.

- Navigate to **MOCALog** --> **Database Trace Console** to open **Trace Analysis** window.

- **Insert into DB**: 
  - Click on the **Insert** button in the **Trace Analysis** window.
  - Enter a **trace filename** (note: providing the full path to the log directory is not required).
  - After entering the filename, click **Insert into DB**.

- This action triggers the Log/Load into DB script, which performs the following:

  - Creates two temporary tables:
    - usr_temp_sql_trace_analysis
    - usr_temp_cmd_trace_analysis
  - Loads these tables with relevant entries from the specified trace file.

- **Load Recent:**
  - Click the Load Recent button to populate the trace selection dropdown.
  - This dropdown will display traces from the current day by default, allowing for quick access to the most recent entries.

- **Search Options:** 

  - Enable the **SQL?** checkbox to perform search operations in either of the temporary trace tables.

  - You can search using the following fields:

    - **Command:** usr_temp_cmd_trace_analysis.uc_cmd(Displays the command executed)

    - **Command Arguments:** usr_temp_cmd_trace_analysis.uc_args(Shows the arguments passed to the command)

    - **Bound SQL:** usr_temp_sql_trace_analysis.uc_bound_sql(SQL statements with all arguments and parameters bound)

    - **Unbound SQL:** usr_temp_sql_trace_analysis.uc_unbound_sql(SQL statements as written before parameter binding)

By leveraging these advanced DevOps features, users can efficiently manage files, maintain source code, handle change management, and perform comprehensive tracing and debugging within the Smart MOCA Client.

## Show End of Trace
The **Show End of Trace** function allows users to quickly view the tail end of a trace file.
- This is particularly useful when monitoring the most recent entries in a log to troubleshoot live or recent events.

## Parse Log
The **Parse Log** tool opens a dedicated window for parsing a selected trace or log file. 
- Within this interface, users can configure parsing options, such as excluding certain default selections, to tailor the analysis output.

**Steps:**
- Uncheck default selections (e.g., unnecessary checkboxes) to refine the parsing criteria.
- Open the trace file for parsing based on the updated options.

**Purpose:**

- Breaks down trace files into structured formats for detailed analysis.
- Filters out noise and focuses on the most relevant sections of the log.


## Open Web Zip File

The **Open Web Zip File** option enables users to open a .zip file containing logs or traces that were downloaded or saved from a web-based interface or external source.

- Opens ZIP files with logs or traces from external sources.

**Usage:**

- Browse your local system to select and open the zipped file.
- Useful when logs are exported from different environments or shared for offline analysis.

**Benefits:**

- Provides an easy way to access and inspect archived log data.
- Supports seamless integration with logs retrieved via web portals or diagnostic exports.


## Change Trace Prefix
The Change Trace Prefix tool allows users to modify the prefix of a trace file. 

- This feature is helpful for organizing trace files by naming conventions or distinguishing between multiple logs during troubleshooting.

**How to Use:**

- Enter the name of the trace file for which the prefix needs to be changed.
- Click on OK to apply the new prefix.

**Advantages:**

- Simplifies log management by maintaining consistent and identifiable file names.
- Avoids overwriting or confusion between different trace sessions.
- Helps in categorizing logs by function, user, or session.
