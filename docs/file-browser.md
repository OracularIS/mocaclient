## Understanding Directories and File Structure.

- The start directory is $LESDIR/src/cmdsrc.
- Within this directory, youâ€™ll find key subfolders such as: 

    - **usrint:** Contains all custom commands developed by users for project-specific enhancements or extensions.

    - **varint:** Standard system commands provided by the application or created by system administrators. This directory should generally remain unmodified to maintain system stability.

    - **usrint.mlvl / varint.mlvl:** These define the command levels and execution sequences. For example, you can determine which custom or standard command runs first during a transaction or trigger.
