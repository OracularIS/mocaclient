# File Browser
The File Browser in the Smart MOCA Client provides a comprehensive set of functionalities that support efficient file navigation, organization, and management.

## Maintaining File System Objects
This section outlines how users can effectively utilize the File Browser for accessing and managing file system objects like commands, reports, logs, and custom scripts.

### File Structure

- The start directory is $LESDIR/src/cmdsrc.
- Within this directory, youâ€™ll find key subfolders such as: 

    - **usrint:** Contains all custom commands developed by users for project-specific enhancements or extensions.

    - **varint:** Standard system commands provided by the application or created by system administrators. This directory should generally remain unmodified to maintain system stability.

    - **usrint.mlvl / varint.mlvl:** These define the command levels and execution sequences. For example, you can determine which custom or standard command runs first during a transaction or trigger.

- This is where modified versions of existing commands or entirely newly created commands can be placed.
