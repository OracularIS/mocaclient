# Report Preview

The Report Viewer in the Smart MOCA Client is a robust and user-friendly tool designed to facilitate the previewing of reports generated during report operations. This functionality allows users to review, verify, and validate the report’s layout, data content, and formatting before finalizing, publishing, or sharing it. By enabling a thorough preview, users can ensure accuracy and completeness, minimizing the risk of errors in the final output.

## Viewing the Report

- After clicking Preview, the selected report will be rendered and displayed within the same window.

- You can scroll through the report using the vertical and horizontal scroll bars to examine each page and section in detail.

- This preview allows you to carefully review formatting, headers, footers, pagination, and the accuracy of the included data.

- If any adjustments are needed—such as correcting parameters, modifying layout, or updating content—you can return to the configuration screen, make changes, and re-preview the report before final submission or export.
