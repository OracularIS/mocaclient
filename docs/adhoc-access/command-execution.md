# Command Execution

Type a command in the text box and hit **ENTER**, **Alt+E**, **F5**, or click the **Execute** button to execute. The status bar below will change to “Executing…” and will change again when execution is complete.

If any text is selected, that text will be executed as the command, and not the entire contents of the text editor.

## Executing Shortcuts

The Smart MOCA Client supports running predefined shortcuts for frequently used commands using the `#` symbol. This feature saves time by allowing users to execute complex commands with simple, memorable shortcuts.

- To run a shortcut, type `#` followed by the shortcut name in the command text box and press ENTER (i.e. to run Find_Command#cmd.msql, type #cmd <command_name>, run #mbuild.msql by typing #mbuild).
